# Pomodoro

## The Pomodoro Technique

### The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

There are six steps in the original technique:

 - Decide on the task to be done.
 - Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
 - Work on the task.
 - End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
 - If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
 - After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then start from the beginning.
